# Terminal Video Player
This is a python script which lets you play a video inside of the terminal!

# For Windows
Curses doesn't normally work on windows, so use
pip install windows-curses

# For Mac and Linux
I currently don't have a way to change the font size on these platforms, so if the video doesn't fit on the screen, you'll have to change it manually.
